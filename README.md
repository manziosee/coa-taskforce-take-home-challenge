# COA TASKFORCE TAKE HOME CHALLENGE

## üìôDescription

This is repository is a collection my solutions for the COA Taskforce Take Home Challenge.

The challenge consists of 3 challenges:
- UI Challenge: Interactive Photo Gallery
- Coding Challenge 1: Array Manipulation
- Coding Challenge 2: String Transformation

## üî©Environment

To be able to run the code solutions on your local environment make sure you have the following tools:
- **IDE**: an Integrated Development Environment application to help you develop more efficiently. I used and recommend VS Code for this challenge but any modern IDE will do. You can download VS Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- **Node.js**: a JavaScript runtime environment that lets you run your JavaScript code outside a browser. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en).
- **Live Server**: an optional tool that allows you to run your HTML pages with a few clicks. You can download Live Server from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or use your ***extensions tab*** if you are in VS Code.
- **Prettier-Code Formatter**: a tool for formatting your code by enforcing consistent style across your project. You can get Prettier from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) or use your ***extensions tab*** if you are in VS Code.

## üìÉInstructions

Below are instructions to get the code solutions and run them locally.

```
git clone repositoryURL
```
replace ***repositoryURL*** with a real URL this will create a folder on your local machine.

- Then open the local folder in VS Code

    * Inside the current folder open the ***Gallery*** folder.
    * If you have Live Server installed `right click on the HTML file and click Open with Live Server`.
    * If you don't have Live Server `open the HTML file in your preferred browser`
- To run the ***Coding Challenges***:
    * Make sure you have *Node.js* installed
    * In VS Code change to the ***Challenges*** directory with the following command
    ```
    cd Challenges
    ```
    * To run ***Coding Challenge 1*** run the following command:
